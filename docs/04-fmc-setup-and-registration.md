# 04 — FMC Setup and FTD Registration

This document covers how to deploy Firepower Management Center (FMC), complete its initial configuration, and register your FTD firewall.

FMC is the central management platform used to control:

- Device onboarding  
- Access Control Policies  
- Intrusion and Malware inspection  
- URL filtering  
- Logging and event analysis  

---

## 1. Initial FMC Setup

Once FMC is deployed and powered on:

1. Access the FMC web UI:
https://<FMC-IP>

markdown
Copy code
2. Complete the setup wizard:
- Accept license agreement  
- Create the **admin** account  
- Configure network settings  
- Apply system updates (recommended)

Check version and update status:

System → Updates

yaml
Copy code

Make sure the FMC is fully patched before onboarding FTD.

---

## 2. Configure System Services

Correct system services help ensure stable communication between FMC and FTD.

### DNS Configuration  
System → Configuration → DNS

shell
Copy code

### Time Synchronization (NTP)  
System → Configuration → Time Synchronization

shell
Copy code

### Licensing  
System → Licenses

yaml
Copy code

Evaluation licenses provide:
- Threat  
- URL  
- Malware  
- Base  

These are sufficient for a full-featured lab.

---

## 3. Add FTD to FMC

To register the firewall:

1. Navigate to:
Devices → Device Management → Add → Add Device

markdown
Copy code
2. Enter:
- **FTD Management IP**  
- **Registration Key** (must match what you entered on the FTD)  
- **Display Name**  
3. Under **Access Control Policy**, choose or create a policy:
- Example: `Enterprise-ACP`

4. Click **Register**.

FMC will automatically begin onboarding the FTD.

---

## 4. Verify Registration Status

Go to:

Devices → Device Management

diff
Copy code

Expected indicators:

- Green checkmark (healthy state)  
- All interfaces discovered  
- License status shown  
- No communication errors  

If registration fails, validate:

- FTD can ping FMC  
- FTD and FMC time/NTP match  
- DNS is correct  
- Registration key matches  
- FMC IP is correct  

On the FTD CLI:

```bash
show managers
This will show whether the FTD is in Pending or Completed state.

5. Deploy Initial Configuration
After the device appears as Healthy, deploy all pending changes:

mathematica
Copy code
Deploy → Deployment → Deploy
This ensures:

ACP policy is installed

System settings are synchronized

FTD is ready for policy and NAT configuration

Summary
At this point:

FMC is online and configured

FTD is successfully registered

Initial Access Control Policy is assigned

All changes have been deployed

Next step:

👉 05-access-control-policy.md

yaml

# 🧠 Why This Version Won’t Break

- All code blocks are closed properly  
- Headings are spaced correctly  
- Lists and bullets are clean  
- Panels and paths match FMC UI  
- No stray text inside code blocks  
- No formatting gaps  

This is production-ready Markdown.

- Threat  
- URL  
- Malware  

These licenses are sufficient for a complete lab.

## 3. Add FTD to FMC

To register the firewall:

1. Navigate to:

yaml
Copy code
2. Enter:
- **FTD Management IP**  
- **Registration Key**  
- **Device Name**  
3. Under **Access Control Policy**, choose or create a starting policy (e.g., `Enterprise-ACP`).

Click **Register** to begin onboarding.

## 4. Verify FTD Registration Status

Check:

Devices → Device Management

diff
Copy code

Expected indicators:

- Green status icon  
- All interfaces discovered  
- License status populated  
- No communication errors  

If issues appear, verify:

- FTD can ping FMC  
- FTD and FMC time/NTP match  
- DNS is working  
- Registration key matches what was configured on FTD  
- FMC IP is correct  

On the FTD CLI:

```bash
show managers
You should see:

The FMC IP

Status: Pending (before join) or Managed / Completed (after join)

5. Deploy Initial Configuration
After the device appears healthy:

mathematica
Copy code
Deploy → Deployment → Deploy
This pushes:

Initial ACP

Licensing

System settings

Certificates

Object databases

Deployment is required before any rule or NAT takes effect.

Summary
By the end of this step:

FMC is fully online

FTD is registered and healthy

An Access Control Policy is attached

All changes have been deployed
